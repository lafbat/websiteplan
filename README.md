scanned info on planning web site

I can't figure out how to upload scanned images.

Notes and ideas:

Develop a logo for my web site, a cute bat in a spider web; have drawn it, but it needs transforming into png

Welcome statement on web page:
    Welcome to my website. It's eclectic, like me. I have divided the content into categories. Click on the appropriate button to explore as you'd like! Thanks for stopping by! Lafbat
    
Buttons on web page:
1) code samples: links to web pages I manage, code in GitHub, professional work portfolio
2) Blog: my life, my opinions
3) Neat stuff: links to cool sites, interesting things; will probably be subdivided into crafts, gardening, computers, science, health, literature
4) Old teacher stuff: a place to put things I created while in the classroom that others might like to use

Site navigation bar: illustrated buttons, grouped together on every page, will include:
    home (bat),  code (html),  blog (open book), neat stuff (flower), teacher stuff (A+)
    
On PC site, add widgets for science news, discovery, etc.

Side bar on PC site: autobiography
    "married with a spoiled dog in NC. Originally from TN. Like to read, bake, craft, garden, and mess with computers. Burned out high school science teacher , reinventing myself."
